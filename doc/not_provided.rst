Converters not provided
==============================

Some converters will not be provided for now. Here is a list and the reason why
it is not provided.


bcl2fastq
-----------------

Illumina provides a bcl2fastq file and its user guide is available online.

In most cases, the BCL files are already converted and users will only get the
FastQ files so we will not provide such converter.
