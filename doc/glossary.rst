    SAM
        Sequence Alignment Map is a generic nucleotide alignment format that
        describes the alignment of query sequences or sequencing reads to a reference
        sequence or assembly. http://samtools.sourceforge.net/

    BAM

        Binary version of the Sequence Alignment Map (SAM) format.
        http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/bam.html

    BED

        Format that defines the data lines displayed in an annotation track.
        (http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat#format1)

    BAI

        The index file for a file generated in the BAM format. (This is a
        non-standard file type.)

    BCF

        TODO

    CRAM

    DSRC

        A compression tool dedicated to FastQ files

    FASTA

        FASTA-formatted sequence files contain either nucleic acid sequence
        (such as DNA) or protein sequence information. FASTA files store multiple
        sequences in a single file. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format

    FASTQ

        FASTQ-formatted sequence files are used to represent high-throughput
        sequencing data, where each read is described by a name, its sequence,
        and its qualities. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format

    GFA

        Graphical Fragment Assembly format. https://github.com/GFA-spec/GFA-spec

    GFF

        General Feature Format, used for describing genes and other features
        associated with DNA, RNA and Protein sequences. 
        http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat#format3

    JSON

        A human-readable data serialization language commonly used in
        configuration files. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON

    PAF

        PAF is a text format describing the approximate mapping positions
        between two set of sequences. 


    PHYLIP

        The PHYLIP file format stores a multiple sequence alignment.

    VCF

        Variant Call Format
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variant_Call_Format

    YAML

        A human-readable data serialization language commonly used in
        configuration files. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML
